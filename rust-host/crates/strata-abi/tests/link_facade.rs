//! Milestone 2 of docs/RUST_HOST.md: the first real call across the Rust/C++ seam.
//!
//! The point of this file is the toolchain question the plan rests on - MSVC, cudart and cargo in one build - so
//! the assertions are about things the shim could not have made up on its own: the version constant it shares
//! with Rust, the answer a *linked C++ library* gives, and the answer a *linked CUDA runtime* gives.
//!
//! It is compiled only when build.rs found a built facade.  On a machine where that has never been built the
//! tests say so and pass, because "the test suite is runnable" cannot depend on someone having run cmake.
//!
//! The DLL is loaded by absolute path rather than linked.  Linking through the import library works - the linker
//! resolves it - but then Windows resolves the DLL itself at process start, from the exe's directory or PATH, and
//! cargo prunes anything it did not put in `deps/` itself.  A test that dies with STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND because of
//! where cargo chose to clean is not a test.  The `extern "system"` bindings are the same either way, which is
//! the part milestone 1 was about: bind to the header directly, no bindgen, no cxx.
