//! Milestone 3 of docs/RUST_HOST.md: the vertical slice. One expert's bytes read by the Rust ring, off a file,
//! through its own IOCP, handed down the seam to the existing kernel, and the answer checked.
//!
//! The two checks are the two halves of the machine, and they are deliberately different in kind:
//!
//!   * **Self-consistency**: the same kernel, on the same bytes, obtained two ways - through the Rust ring, and
//!     through an ordinary buffered read - must give the same answer.  This is what catches the ring corrupting,
//!     short-changing or mis-aligning a read.
//!   * **Structure**: a *different* blob must give a *different* answer.  Self-consistency alone cannot catch a
//!     wrong file offset, because a read that always returns the wrong window is still self-consistent - the
//!     parity lesson from `expert_parity`, applied here.
//!
//! It is Windows-only (IOCP), and it needs a built facade; without one it says so and passes, like the seam
//! tests in strata-abi.  The kernel is the existing one - no Rust kernel code anywhere - and the facade refuses
//! with DEVICE_UNAVAILABLE on a CPU it has not been given permission to run it on, which the test reports rather
//! than hides.
