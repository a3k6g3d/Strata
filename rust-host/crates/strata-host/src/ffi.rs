//! The C exports: calls Rust implements and the C++ engine makes - the reverse of every `STRATA_API` export in
//! include/strata/c/abi.h.  Milestone 5 of docs/RUST_ENGINE.md.
//!
//! The crate is built as a DLL (`cdylib`) that the engine loads by absolute path, mirroring how strata_facade.dll
//! is loaded the other way.  A staticlib linked into the engine was measured and rejected: MSVC fails to link it
//! (`LNK2019 __imp_GetUserProfileDirectoryW`, from Rust's own `std::env::home_dir`) unless `onecoreuap.lib` is
//! added to the C++ link.  As a DLL, Rust's `std` stays inside it and that symbol never reaches the engine's link.
//!
//! The surface is `platform::DirectFile`'s, one call for one method, so the engine's caller can swap readers
//! without changing what it does: open/size, submit into memory the engine owns, wait for completions, wake from
//! another thread, close, and the two aligned-allocation helpers.  The rules are the header's:
//!
//!   * No panic crosses the seam.  Every export catches it and answers `STRATA_ERR_DEVICE_UNAVAILABLE` with the
//!     panic's text in `strata_host_last_error`, because unwinding into C++ frames is undefined behaviour.
//!   * The file handle is Rust's (a `Box` the engine holds as an opaque pointer); the read buffers are the
//!     engine's.  The ring holds a submitted buffer until its completion is handed back, and close does not
//!     return while the kernel may still write one.
//!   * Threading is the C++ reader's: one thread makes every call except `wake`, which any thread may make.
