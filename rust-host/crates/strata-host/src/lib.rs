//! The Rust host's own async read path: a completion ring over a direct-access (unbuffered) file.
//! See docs/RUST_HOST.md, milestone 3.
//!
//! This is the half of the vertical slice that is Rust's to own.  The bytes are read here, by this process,
//! through its own input/output completion port - not through the C++ engine's reader - and then handed down the
//! seam to the existing kernels.  What the crate is for is the two rules the plan says the Rust side exists to
//! enforce:
//!
//!   * **A buffer that is in flight is owned by the ring, not by the caller.**  `submit` takes the buffer by
//!     value and `wait_into` hands it back inside the completion.  There is no way to drop it, resize it or walk
//!     away from it while the kernel still owns the memory - the type system will not let the borrow that used to
//!     be a comment in `expert_source.hpp` happen.  That is the whole reason the host layer is in Rust, so it is
//!     the thing this file is built to demonstrate.
//!   * **A full ring refuses loudly and drops nothing.**  That rule is strata-abi's `Ring`'s, and `wait_into`
//!     takes one, so the rule is enforced by the same code on both sides of the seam.
//!
//! Direct access is the point and the price: every read's offset, length and buffer address must be a multiple of
//! the sector size (4096 here), which is why a blob is read as a whole number of pages and the geometry below
//! pads.  The C++ reader does the same thing for the same reason (`expert_source.hpp`, the 4 KiB-aligned windows
//! scattered into blobs).
