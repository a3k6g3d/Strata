//! M6 of docs/RUST_ENGINE.md: the transient-blob lifetime rule as a type.
//!
//! The rule today is a comment (`include/strata/core/expert_source.hpp`, `transient`): a blob assembled into a
//! short-lived buffer "stays valid for the layer it was asked in and the next one or two; a consumer that keeps a
//! blob longer copies it".  Nothing checks it.  A consumer that keeps a pointer one layer too long reads whatever the
//! next expert's bytes are - silently, and only on the runs where the buffer happened to be recycled in time.
//!
//! Here it is two guarantees, deliberately different in kind, because a borrow cannot say "two more layers":
//!
//!   * **Static.**  The bytes are only ever reached through `&TransientRing` (`TransientRing::bytes`), and moving to
//!     the next layer takes `&mut TransientRing` (`advance`).  So no reference into a slot can live across an
//!     advance - the compiler refuses it.  To keep a blob across layers you keep the `Lease`, which is a value, not a
//!     borrow, and ask again.
//!   * **Checked.**  Asking again with a lease past its window - or for a slot recycled since - is refused with
//!     `Status::BadSlot`, never answered with someone else's bytes.  The slot carries a generation that changes every
//!     time it is reused, and the lease remembers the one it was given.  That refusal is the loud failure M6's gate
//!     asks for: "a consumer keeping a blob too long fails loudly rather than silently".
//!
//! A slot is reused only once its epoch is outside the window, so a lease inside its window can never be refused -
//! the check costs a valid consumer nothing but a compare.  A ring with no reusable slot refuses to stage
//! (`WouldBlock`) instead of recycling a slot that is still promised to someone.
